### TERN

[TERN](https://www.tern.org.au/) measures key terrestrial ecosystem attributes at hundreds of representative locations across Australia, including repeating those measures through time.

At field locations across Australia plots and transects are used to detect and quantify change in vegetation structure and composition, land cover and soil characteristics.

TERN data were imported to `R` using the `ausplotsR` package `r cite_package("ausplotsR")`.
