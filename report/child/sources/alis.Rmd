### ALIS 

[ALIS](https://www.pir.sa.gov.au/aghistory/natural_resources/pastoral_land_management) (Arid Lands Information System), maintained by the Department of Primary Industries and Regions, stores data associated with the monitoring of land condition on pastoral leases in South Australia.

Monitoring is generally done along a fixed 4 m x 100 m transect and enables a density and frequency estimate of perennials for each site [@RN4553] via:

* 100 small (2 m x 2 m) quadrats along each side of the belt transect
* recordings made for each qudrat
* identification of perennial plant species.

ALIS data were imported to `R` using the `DBI` package `r cite_package("DBI")`.
