## Workflow

The data import, cleaning, analysis and report writing were done in a scripted workflow using the programs `R` and 'R-studio Desktop'. [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) [@R-base] is an open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Base R can be extended via a range of open source packages to enable specific tasks or analyses. The packages used to produce this report are listed in Table \@ref(tab:packages).

[R-studio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is a set of open source tools built to facilitate interaction with `R`.

                        ) %>%
          dplyr::left_join(tibble::as_tibble(devtools::session_info(include_base = TRUE)$packages)) %>%
